        <h2>The Story Behind the Bronzes</h2>
        <p>Over 600 years ago, skillful artists in Benin made bronzes to tell stories about kings, warriors, and daily life. These artworks were placed in the royal palace to show power and history.</p>
        <p>During the British colonial invasion, the British took many of these precious bronzes and carried them away. Today, majority of these artifacts are scattered around the world in museums.</p>
